# wprsrv

*wprsrv* is a reservations plugin for WordPress.

## About

*wprsrv* was created to reinvent the wheel yet again. I tried a few different reservation plugins but none seemed to be
the best choice for my use case. So I went a recreated reservations for WordPress.

The plugin is quite extensible and does not do more than enough. This includes:

-   Reservables as a post type
-   Reservations as a post type
-   Customizations and settings for each reservable
-   Approve or decline reservations in the `wp-admin` panel
-   Render a baseline reservation form for all reservables where needed
-   Email notifications

## Usage and extending

Please view the [documentation](/documentation) to learn the usage and extendability of this plugin.

## Contributing
